# SkyblockRemastered
 
## What happened?

SkyblockRemastered was ended because of our lost hope and dream of creating a better Skyblock. The game was dying, and we weren't enjoying it as much as we did when we started the project.


## Why is the repo public?

We hope that others will be inspired by this team effort and possibly even continue the project! It's up to you.


All good things must come to an end...
